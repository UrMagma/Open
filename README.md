## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FortniteServer**: Main server class that coordinates all components
2. **GameMode**: Handles Battle Royale game logic, phases, and victory conditions
3. **PlayerManager**: Manages player connections, teams, stats, and inventory
4. **NetworkManager**: Handles client connections and packet communication
5. **ConsoleManager**: Provides server administration and logging

### Game Flow

1. **WaitingToStart**: Server waits for minimum players to join
2. **WarmUp**: 30-second preparation phase, loot spawns
3. **Aircraft**: 60-second battle bus phase, players can jump
4. **SafeZones**: Storm phases begin, players battle for survival
5. **EndGame**: Victory conditions met, match ends

### Storm System

- 5 configurable storm phases
- Dynamic storm center repositioning
- Gradual radius shrinking
- Damage scaling per phase
- Automatic phase transitions

## Building

### Requirements

- CMake 3.16 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Platform: Windows/macOS/Linux

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd Fortnite_Server_1_8_0

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Build the server
cmake --build . --config Release

# Run the server
./bin/FortniteServer_1_8_0
```

### Build Options

```bash
# Debug build
cmake --build . --config Debug

# With custom options
./bin/FortniteServer_1_8_0 --port 7777 --max-players 100 --debug

# Help
./bin/FortniteServer_1_8_0 --help
```

## Configuration

The server uses `config/server_config.json` for configuration:

### Server Settings
- Name and description
- Port and player limits  
- Game mode settings
- Network configuration

### Game Settings
- Building enabled/disabled
- Storm configuration
- Aircraft settings
- Loot spawn rates
- Weapon damage multipliers

### Example Configuration
```json
{
    "server": {
        "name": "Fortnite Private Server v1.8.0",
        "port": 7777,
        "max_players": 100
    },
    "gamemode": {
        "type": "solo",
        "building_enabled": true,
        "storm_enabled": true
    },
    "storm": {
        "phases": [
            {
                "duration": 240,
                "damage_per_second": 1.0,
                "shrink_time": 60
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## Console Commands

The server includes a comprehensive console system:

### Basic Commands
- `help` - Show available commands
- `status` - Display server status  
- `players` - List connected players
- `quit` - Shutdown server

### Game Management

3. **Building Logic**: Implement using `ABuildingSMActor`
4. **Network Protocol**: Extend `NetworkManager` packet types

### Code Style

- Modern C++17 features
- RAII and smart pointers
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive logging and debugging

### Testing

The server includes built-in testing features:
- Simulated player connections
- Debug commands for testing
- Comprehensive logging system
- Configuration validation

## Deployment

### Production Setup

2. Configure `server_config.json`
3. Set up proper networking (port forwarding)
4. Configure logging and monitoring
5. Set up automatic restart scripts

### Performance

- Multi-threaded architecture
- Optimized for 100 concurrent players
- Memory management with smart pointers
- Network optimization

## Support
